<h1>Brief</h1>

A group of artists has asked you to create an app that maps street art around the world. The system is primarily for artists, but anyone vetted by the organisation should be able to use it to upload photographs of street art, and pin them to a specific location.

<h2>MVP</h2>
Your system must be able to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the user to place a pin to a specific location</li>
  <li>Add/update information to the pin</li>
  <li>Allow a user to add an image link to the pin</li>
  <li>Attach image to a specific pin</li>
  <li>Display a list of all the images</li>
  <li>Add some styling with CSS</li>
  <li>Set up a database to save the pinned information</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Extensions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Display street art by author</li>
  <li>Display images by country/city</li>
  <li>Allow users to upload their own images</li>
  <li>Allow artists to create a profile (if theyâ€™re an artist, their profile will display all their artwork)</li>
</ul>


## To run the app

In your Terminal, go to the project directory and run:
<ul>
  <li>npm install</li>
  <li>npm start</li>
</ul>
Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser.
